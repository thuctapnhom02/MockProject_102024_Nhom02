          <p className="font-normal text-2xl text-black/70">
            In order to help your tenants stay on top of rent payments, we send out monthly invoices (including a
            detailed breakdown of charges to their account) to remind them to payment is coming due.

            notice.

            After a tenant notifies us of their intent to move, we reply by scheduling a pre-move out inspection and we
            send them a Move Out Letter, which states the expectations regarding the condition of the property.
